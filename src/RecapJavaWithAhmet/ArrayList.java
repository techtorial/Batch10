    //WHAT IS DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ARRAY AND ARRAYLIST
    //* ARRAY HAS FIXED SIZE , ARRAYLIST IS DYNAMIC
    //*ARRAY CAN STORE OBJECT AND PRIMITIVES , ARRAYLIST JUST OBJECT
    //*ARRAY HAS ONLY LENGTH, ARRAYLIST HAS METHODS AND SIZE METHOD
    //*ARRAY CAN BE MULTIDIMENSIONAL, ARRAYLIST CANNOT
    //*THEY HAVE DIFFERENT SYNTHAX
